# Changes Made to SeeSea Project

## Summary of Changes

The following changes were made to migrate the SeeSea project from SQLite to PostgreSQL and fix Redis configuration issues:

### 1. Database Migration (SQLite to PostgreSQL)

- Updated `.env` file to use PostgreSQL connection string
- Modified `app/config.py` to use DATABASE_URL from environment variables
- Updated `create_db.py` to be database-agnostic and import all models
- Added `psycopg2-binary` to `requirements.txt` for PostgreSQL connectivity

### 2. Redis Configuration Fixes

- Updated all Redis URLs in `.env` to consistently use port 6380
- Modified `celery_worker.py` to use environment variables for Redis URL

### 3. Dependency Issues

- Added `protobuf==3.20.0` to `requirements.txt` to address compatibility issues
- Documented the known conflict with onnx 1.18.0 in README.md

### 4. Documentation

- Created comprehensive README.md with setup and configuration instructions
- Added database migration guide
- Included troubleshooting tips

## Verification Steps

To verify that the changes work correctly, follow these steps:

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Database Initialization

```bash
# Make sure PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose up -d

# Create database tables
python create_db.py
```

Verify that the output shows "Creating tables in PostgreSQL database..." and "Database tables created successfully in PostgreSQL."

### 3. Application Startup

```bash
# Start Flask application
flask run
```

In a separate terminal:

```bash
# Start Celery worker
celery -A celery_worker worker --loglevel=info
```

### 4. Functionality Testing

1. **User Registration and Login**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5000/auth/register
   - Create a new user account
   - Log in with the created account

2. **Reference Image Upload**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5000/upload
   - Upload face and surfboard images
   - Verify that embeddings are generated

3. **Video Processing**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5000/upload/video
   - Upload a surf video
   - Start processing and verify that frames are detected and matched

### 5. Database Verification

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U seesea -d seesea

# List tables
\dt

# Check user data
SELECT * FROM users;
```

## Known Issues

- Protobuf 3.20.0 conflicts with onnx 1.18.0 (which requires protobuf>=4.25.1)
- This conflict doesn't affect core functionality but may cause warnings

## Next Steps

- Consider upgrading to a newer version of onnx that's compatible with protobuf 3.20.0
- Implement proper error handling for database connection issues
- Add database migration scripts for easier data transfer
