Files that can be safely deleted:
1. celery_worker.py.new - Fragment of the main celery_worker.py file without proper function definition
2. personal_ for_ testing/ directory - Contains test data not essential for the main application
3. update_paths.py - One-time fix for SQLite database paths that has already been applied
4. update_postgres_paths.py - One-time fix for PostgreSQL database paths in the surfer_frames table
5. update_postgres_video_paths.py - One-time fix for PostgreSQL database paths in the surf_videos table
6. check_postgres_paths.py - Diagnostic tool for checking paths in PostgreSQL

Justification:
- The celery_worker.py.new file is an incomplete fragment of the main celery_worker.py file.
- The personal_ for_ testing directory contains test videos and UI testing data that are not essential for the main application.
- The path-related scripts were created for one-time fixes that have already been applied, as documented in path_fix_summary.md.
- The document mentions that code changes have been made to ensure new records are stored with the correct path format, so these scripts are no longer needed for regular operation.

Before deleting these files, it's recommended to:
1. Ensure all database migrations have been completed
2. Verify that the path issues have been fully resolved in both development and production environments
3. Create a backup of the files before deletion
